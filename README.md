# ðŸ“Š Global Superstore Data Analysis â€“ Capstone Project

This project presents a comprehensive analysis of the Global Superstore dataset . Using Power BI, Power Query, and DAX, the dataset was explored to uncover business insights on sales, profit, shipping costs, discount effectiveness, and customer value across various regions and product categories.

The analysis focused on the year 2014 and aimed to answer real-world business questions, such as identifying top-performing countries and products, uncovering underperforming regions, and recommending data-driven strategies to optimize profitability. Interactive dashboards and KPI cards were used to highlight key metrics, trends, and actionable insights that support strategic decision-making for global retail operations.
